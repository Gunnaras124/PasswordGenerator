🔐 PasswordEncrypter.com

(Definitely a real website. Trust me.)

🧠 What Is This?

PasswordEncrypter.com is a Tkinter-based application that:

Generates passwords

Encrypts them

Decrypts them*

Uses today’s date as cryptographic destiny

* “Decrypt” may not mean what you think it means.

🎯 Features

🔢 Random password generator

🔐 Custom-built encryption algorithm™

📅 Encryption key based on today’s day + month

📋 One-click clipboard copying

🎨 Fancy Ubuntu theme for professional hacker vibes

🧪 How It Works (Totally Secure, Trust Me)
1️⃣ Generate a Password

Choose:

Length (6–10, because longer is scary)

Strength:

🟢 Low → lowercase letters

🟡 Medium → upper & lowercase letters

🔴 Strong → letters, numbers, symbols, and chaos

Click Generate and behold your new password.

2️⃣ Encrypt the Password

Click Encrypt to:

Shift each character using a secret key

The key is calculated as:

(day + month) × 2


Hackers hate calendars.

3️⃣ Decrypt the Password

Click Decrypt to:

Restore the original password

(By simply showing it again 😌)

Security through confidence.

🏁 Final Thoughts

This app:

Looks professional

Feels powerful
